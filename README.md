## Overview

This application serves as a comprehensive tool for retail business owners to gain deep insights from their sales data. Users can upload a CSV or Excel file and choose between three powerful analysis modes:

1.  **Standard Dashboard:** A traditional, multi-tab dashboard offering pre-defined visualizations of key metrics, including sales trends, product performance, geographical analysis, customer behavior, and market basket insights.
2.  **AI-Driven Analysis:** A cutting-edge feature where a powerful Large Language Model (Llama 3 via Groq) acts as an autonomous data scientist. The AI explores the data, generates its own hypotheses, and creates a unique, in-depth report with dynamically generated graphs and business explanations.
3.  **Future Strategy Report:** A forward-looking analysis where the AI acts as a business strategist, using historical data to provide forecasts, identify growth opportunities, and highlight potential risks.
